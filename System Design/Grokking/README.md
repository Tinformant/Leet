## Load Balancing

Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system. 

It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases. 
LB also keeps track of the status of all the resources while distributing requests. 
If a server is not available to take new requests or is not responding or has elevated error rate, LB will stop sending traffic to such a server.
