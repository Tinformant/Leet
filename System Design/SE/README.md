## Regression Testing
Key idea: When you find a bug
* Write a test that exhibits the bug
* Always run the test when code changes
  * ensures bug doesn’t reappear
* Helps ensure forward progress
  * Ideally, we never go back to old bugs
• Note that automation is key
  * Set of test cases increases over time
  * Without automation, would be too hard to re-execute
