## 706 Design HashMap
### Two Issues: Hash Function Design & Collision Handling
1) hash function design: the purpose of hash function is to map a key value to an address in the storage spacefor a good hash function, it should map different keys evenly across the storage space.

2) collision handling: essentially the hash function reduces the vast key space into a limited address space and collision is inevitable.
